# Learning Framework

* This repo is an extension of the basic [open games engine](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs). It provides a playground for learning games.

* The underlying repo is a Haskell combinator library implementing _open games_, a battery of examples, and a code generation tool for making the combinator library practical to work with.

# Run the code

You can use `stack build` to compile the project, `stack test` will run the tests
`stack ghci` and `stack ghci --test` will run ghci using the main target or the test
targets respectively.


# Usage

There is a [tutorial](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs/blob/master/Tutorial/TUTORIAL.md) how to use the software for modelling.
