# Learning Framework

* This repo is an extension of the basic open games engine. It provides a playground for learning games.



# Refactored version

This repo is a refactored and simplified implementation on the basis of [this](https://github.com/jules-hedges/open-game-engine) version by Jules Hedges.

It will serve as a basis for several specialized applications.




# Open games in Haskell

This is a Haskell combinator library implementing open games, a battery of examples, and a code generation tool for making the combinator library practical to work with.

This tool allows modular definition of games, and then checking (but not computing) different types of Nash equilibria. After entering a non-equilibrium, the tool can generate detailed information about deviations.

For background on open games, see these two papers:
* [Compositional game theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641) by Ghani, Hedges, Winschel and Zahn
* [Bayesian open games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03656) by Bolt, Hedges and Zahn

I hope that this tool will be usable without in-depth knowledge of how it works or how open games work, but I can't make any promises.

From a user's perspective, the examples in `Examples` are intended to be self-documenting. Studying the modules in that directory will be more effective than any documentation I could write.

When I have time I plan to write a paper describing how the preprocessor works.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:juleshedges.invariant@gmail.com) (ie. [Jules Hedges](https://julesh.com/)) if you have specific questions. ("Why doesn't this block compile correctly?" is a reasonable question.)

Also contact me if you'd like to contribute! A concrete syntax and parser for blocks is an example of something that would be easy to add for a better programmer than me.

## The preprocessor

In order to use the preprocessor, create a value of type `Preprocessor.AbstractSyntax.Block`, and then interactively (in GHCi) apply the function `Preprocessor.Preprocessor.compileBlock`. The resulting `Show` instance will result in a string containing Haskell code. Copy this code from the terminal into a file that makes the appropriate imports from `Engine`.

Examples of blocks can be seen in `Examples`, and in each case the resulting generated code can be seen right after the block definition.

The scoping rules for blocks are quite complicated, and reflect the topological rules for string diagrams of open games:
* Block inputs and line outputs (both covariant and contravariant) are variables, which are brought into scope (I think they could be general patterns, but I haven't tested it properly)
* Covariant inputs of lines are expressions which can contain variables brought into scope by the covariant inputs of the block, and the covariant outputs of any previous line
* The covariant outputs of the block are expressions which can contain variables brought into scope by the covariant inputs of the block and the covariant outputs of any line
* Contravariant inputs of lines are expressions which can contain variables brought into scope by any inputs of the block, the covariant outputs of any line, and the contravariant outputs of any later line
* The contravariant outputs of the block are expressions which can contain variables brought into scope by any inputs of the block and any outputs of any line

(Think: covariant values flow downwards, then turn around and come back upwards. Contravariant values only flow upwards.)

The preprocessor does no scope or type checking, so if you make a mistake then you will get a (probably large) error message when you compile the generated code.

## Using the Template Haskell code generator

In addition to using `Block`, one can use `QBlock` and `QLine` by importing
`Preprocessor.THSyntax` and add `{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}` at the top of the file
as a language pragma. This allows to define blocks _inline_ without copy pasting generated code
through GHCI using a syntax very similar to the one for `Block`. In order to generate the code
for a `QBlock` or a list of `QLine`, you need to call the function `generateGame` at the top
level of your file with a function name given as a string and a list of strings for the
arguments this function will use. The last argument is the `QBlock` that define the game.

This approach as some known limitations:

- All the intermediate terms have to be quoted with `[|â€¦|]` which makes the syntax look really
confusing when they are within lists
- The block context can only return parameters and not expressions.

## Run the code

You can use `stack build` to compile the project, `stack test` will run the tests
`stack ghci` and `stack ghci --test` will run ghci using the main target or the test
targets respectively.

## Docker build

Build an image with the source in it:

    docker image build -f pzahn/learning/src.Dockerfile -t registry.gitlab.com/pzahn/learning/src:2021-05-24 .

Build a base image with stack and haskell dependencies in it:

    docker image build -f pzahn/learning/base.Dockerfile -t registry.gitlab.com/pzahn/learning/base:2021-05-24 pzahn/

Building the final image for running:

    docker image build -f pzahn/learning/final.Dockerfile . -t registry.gitlab.com/pzahn/learning/final:2021-05-24

OK, now you can upload everything:

    docker push registry.gitlab.com/pzahn/learning/src:2021-05-24
    docker push registry.gitlab.com/pzahn/learning/base:2021-05-24
    docker push registry.gitlab.com/pzahn/learning/final:2021-05-24

Ideally, you'll change the date tag when you change an image.
